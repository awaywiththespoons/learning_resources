# Learning Resources
A collection of learning resources developed at intersection of art+tech. Unless otherwise stated, all material is licensed with CC-by-SA 4.0

Currently I have images of activities, and will upload more details soon (such as lesson plans and worksheets). This is a new resource so bare with me while I add to it.
